* Novatek's SDHCI Controller device tree bindings

Novatek's SDHCI controller is used as a connectivity interface with external
MMC, SD and eMMC storage mediums. This file documents differences between the
core mmc properties described by mmc.txt and the properties used by the
Novatek implementation of the SDHCI controller.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "nvt,hsmmc": For controllers compatible with Novatek TV sdhci
    controller.


Example:

	nfc@0xfc048000 {
		compatible = "nvt,nfc";
		//    NFC
		reg = <0xfc048000 0x200>;
		interrupts = <0 63 4>;
	};

	mmc@0xfc048300 {
		compatible = "nvt,hsmmc";
		//    SDC                 NFC                 FCR
		reg = <0xfc048300 0x100>, <0xfc048000 0x200>, <0xfc048200 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 63 4>;
		max-bus-frequency = <180000000>;
	};

	Note: This example shows both SoC specific and board specific properties
	in a single device node. The properties can be actually be separated
	into SoC specific node and board specific node.
