1. htop 	- Linux Process Monitoring
		Rootfs:
		  $cp __install/share/terminfo/ rootfs/usr/share/
		  $cp __install/bin/htop rootfs/bin/
		Target board:
		  $export TERM=xterm
		  $export TERMINFO=/usr/share/terminfo
		  $htop

2. gdb		- It can use gdbserver to do remote debug application, or using gdb to do on-target debugging

3. Bonnie++	- This is used to measure the file system IO performance
		$bonnie++ -d FolderName -r RamSize -s TestingSize -u UID:GID

4. mtd-utils	- This is the MTD device utilities to handle flash read/write, ubifs attach/mount/format

5. memtester	- To handle RAM R/W testing for the stability

6. iperf	- Iperf was developed as a modern alternative for measuring maximum TCP and UDP bandwidth performance. Iperf allows the tuning of various parameters and UDP characteristics.
		Iperf reports bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss. Iperf can run as a client or as a server according to the arguments passed to it. Unlike NetPerf,
		when using Iperf we need to configure both client and server sides.

7. procps	- slabtop, uptime, watch, vmstat, tload,...etc  tools
		Target board:
		  $export TERM=xterm
		  $export TERMINFO=/usr/share/terminfo
		  $slabtop

8. mmctest	- To do RAW MMC driver testing, this is the linux kernel feature will test your sd card without file system affection.

9. i2c-tools	- Please refer to http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/i2cToolsDocumentation for usage
