    LVDS/HiSPi Controller global header

    LVDS/HiSPi controller is basically the high speed sensor interface controller.
    In NT96680, Eight lvds engines are implemented.
    The user can reference this section for the detail description of the each driver API usage
    and also the parameter descriptions and its limitations.
    The overall combinational usage flow is introduced in the application note document,
    and the user must reference to the application note for the driver usage flow.
