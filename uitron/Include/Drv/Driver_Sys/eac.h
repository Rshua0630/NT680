/**
    Embedded Audio Codec(EAC) Analog to Digital (Record) Configuration Selection

    This definition is used in eac_setAdConfig() to select which of the recording function is selected to assign new configuration.
    When configuring the PGA Gain (EAC_CONFIG_AD_PGAGAIN_L and EAC_CONFIG_AD_PGAGAIN_R), the setting is valid only
    if the ALC is disabled becuase the PGA gain would under ALC control if ALC is enabled.
    The user should also notice that the Digital Gain 1 is under ALC control, so the adjustment of the Digital Gain 1
    may be restored back from the PGA gain if the ALC target is unchanged.
    Besides, after changing the settings of EAC_CONFIG_AD_DGAIN1_L / EAC_CONFIG_AD_DGAIN1_R /EAC_CONFIG_AD_DGAIN2_L / EAC_CONFIG_AD_DGAIN2_R
    / EAC_CONFIG_AD_ALC_TARGET / EAC_CONFIG_AD_PGAGAIN_L / EAC_CONFIG_AD_PGAGAIN_R, the user must also call eac_setLoad() to activate the new settings.
    The user can reference to the eac application note for the basic functional blocks of the embedded audio codec functional blocks.

/**
    Configure IIR filter coefficients (7-entries)

    EAC embeds a second order IIR filter. This API is used to configure the filter coefficients.
    The IIR can assign different filter coefficients for left/right channel and the selection is controlled
    by input parameter iirCH. The input coefficients pCoef have 7 entries. They are:
    pCoef[0]=B0,pCoef[1]=B1,pCoef[2]=B2,pCoef[3]=A0,pCoef[4]=A1,pCoef[5]=A2,pCoef[6]=TotalGain.
    The second order IIR equation is H(z) =  ((B0 + B1*Z1 + B2*Z2) / (A0 - A1*Z1 - A2*Z2)) x (Total-Gain).
    The user can get the floating point parameters from MATLAB simulation and feeds the floating point coefficient
    to EAC_IIRCOEF() to convert to EAC used fixed point INT32 coefficients.
    The floating point coefficient supported range is from -2.0 ~ +1.999969482421875.

    @param[in] iirCH    IIR channel selection. Please refer to EAC_IIRCH definition.
